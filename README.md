This is a Simple_Shell Collaborative Project written in C Language. 
It is one of the many hand-on-deck project instituted in the ALX_2022 Software Engineering Program meant to equip African Teck enthusiasts with the requisite Software Development skills that adresses most 21s century ITC challenges both industry and personal development wise. 

CORE OBJECTIVES
This project aims at providing the students with indepth understanding of the following;
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell.

How to execute another program with the execve system call.
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates.
What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

OUTPUT
The program has the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
Where the program prints an error, the name of the program is equivalent to argv[0]
